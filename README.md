# Finding the Groove: Uncovering Business Insights of Chinook Music Store

## Introduction

In this project, we will be working with the Chinook database, which contains information about a digital music store. The database includes data on artists, songs, albums, employees, customers, and purchases, and is composed of eleven tables.

The main **goal of this project** is to uncover business insights from the data in the Chinook database by answering the following business questions:

1. Identify the top three albums from a new record label to add to the store.
2. Analyze the sales performance of sales support agents to identify the best performer.
3. Analyze sales by country to determine average sales and order value.
4. Determine if more revenue is generated from individual track purchases or album purchases.
